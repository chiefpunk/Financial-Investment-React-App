# TraderBlue

TraderBlue is an investment portfolio management and paper-trading app where users can develop trading skills and test investment strategies with real-time market data

I designed TraderBlue with three different types of users in mind:

- People with a budding interest in stock-market investing, but dont have the risk-tolerance (or the money!) to make their first purchase with real cash
- Educators who want to provided finance, business, or economics students with a chance to learn what it means to buy, sell, and research investments
- Seasoned investors who want to try out a risky new strategy without betting the farm

# As a user, I can:

- Securely login to my account, knowing that my password is not stored in plaintext
- View index of my portfolio
- Select a portfolio to view and trade in
- View a portfolio's cash, investments, and total value
- Manually add or reduce cash, and add investment position to portfolio without changing cash
- Search for any publicly traded stock by ticker symbol
- View a stock's performance over time with detailed, interactive charting
- View a stock's current trading information, such as Price, Day Change, Open Price, Day Range, Market Cap, P/E Ratio, and more
- Use cash to buy first shares of a stock, or add to an existing position
- Sell entire or portion of a position and immediately receive cash value of sold shares
- View up-to-date news stories related to stocks I own, stocks on my watchlist, or stocks I have searched for
- Add and Remove a Stock from the watchlist
- View current investments sorted alplabetically, by quantity, value, and gain/loss
- Filter by name the stocks I own and have on watchlist by name
